        <h1>About Us</h1>

        <p>Wolf Tang Clan provides unique products that reflect the old and new school military lifestyle and it strives to honor and highlight the warrior culture and all those whose sacrifices and actions tend to be forgotten.</p>

We are proud to give insight to the past so others can understand our present. All of our products, blogs and articles directly reflect the type of humor, toughness, and perseverance that has been instilled in each warrior generation.</p>
            
        <p><a href="signers.html#page">We hold these truths</a> to be <em>self-evident</em>, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.</p>    
        <h2>Problems with the King</h2> 
            <ul>
                <li>He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.</li>
                <li>He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.</li>
